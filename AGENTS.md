# Portalkeeper Development Guide

## Vaultrona fork (buildthehomelab/wow-Portalkeeper)

This fork is built for one realm and changes three upstream rules on purpose:

* **The realm is built in.** `src/Portalkeeper/Branding/azeroth.realm.conf` is embedded in the executable and copied into the realm store on first run (`RealmBranding`). Its `ConfigURL` keeps it current.
* **Players log in with their game account** before using the launcher (`LauncherAccountService`, the portal's `api/launcher/`). The token is stored with DPAPI on Windows and owner-only on Linux; the password is never stored.
* **The fork distributes the client and patches** over BitTorrent with the realm's web seed (`TorrentService`, MonoTorrent). This replaces the upstream "Portalkeeper does not distribute the World of Warcraft client" rule below for this fork only. The safety rules that come with it:
  * only a complete, hash-verified copy is ever shared; a modified or partial client is not shared and nothing is downloaded into it;
  * a new install goes into an empty folder, one this install started (marked by `.portalkeeper/client-install.json`), or a folder that already holds a WoW client, which becomes the realm's client in place: only what fails the torrent's hashes is downloaded;
  * **the client is held to exactly what the realm ships** (`ClientConformanceService`, built-in realm only): the client torrent's files plus the realm's patches. Anything else in the game folder (other MPQs, dlls, exes) is deleted; a client that isn't the realm's has to go through INSTALL WOW, and the launcher's own install updates itself in place when its files change. Only what `make-client-torrent.py` leaves out is the player's: the top-level Interface, WTF, Cache, Logs, Screenshots and Errors folders, realmlist.wtf and Config.wtf. Keep the two rule sets in step;
  * patches are still SHA-256 checked against realm.conf before they're installed, and fall back to HTTP when the torrent fails;
  * sharing pauses while the game runs and can be turned off in Settings.
* **Required and Recommended patches and Required addons install and update automatically**; players only manage optional addons (there is no patch list, so Recommended patches would otherwise be unreachable). A launcher left open asks the realm's ConfigURL every 90 seconds and refreshes the realm when realm.conf changed (`CheckRealmConfigurationOnTickAsync`, only while nothing else runs), so a new patch version installs without a restart. Once the launcher has installed an optional (or recommended) realm addon, it updates automatically too until the player uninstalls it (`StartOptionalAddonUpdates`, after each sync). That runs beside everything else and never holds up ENTER REALM: launching, other addon/patch changes, refreshes and a new client folder cancel it first. Each version is tried once per launcher run, failures show in Manage Addons, GitHub addons go by commit, and folders the player put in by hand and personal addons stay manual. Addon backups keep the newest 3 sets per addon.

* **Installed Windows builds update themselves** (`PortalkeeperUpdateService`): a newer release's Setup exe is downloaded from this fork's releases, checked against GitHub's published SHA-256 for the asset (no checksum, no install), and run with `/VERYSILENT /RELAUNCH=1` after Portalkeeper closes, only when no game, install or download is running. The installer's `RelaunchAfterUpdate` entry reopens it. Portable zips and Linux keep the update notice. Release checks ask the portal's `api/launcher/version.php` (at startup and every minute; the release workflow announces each release to it, signed with the `PORTAL_RELEASE_SECRET` Actions secret) and fall back to GitHub's API, at most every 6 hours, only when the portal can't answer; the portal only names the tag, never a download URL.

* **The launcher is one window with pages** (`MainWindow.axaml`, `MainViewModel.Pages.cs`, `Views/Pages/`): a borderless window whose top bar is the navigation: HOME, SHOP, ARMORY, CALENDAR, PATCH NOTES and ADDONS as links (each shown only when the realm has it; ADDONS needs a valid client), WEBSITE (the browser), the settings gear, minimize and close. The page sits under the top bar; the status card, launcher-update and crash banners, ENTER REALM and the footer stay at the bottom of every page. Home is the logo with the realm status, live info and what's new beside it. A page is a `UserControl` bound to the `MainViewModel` (`ShopPage`, `ArmoryPage`, `CalendarPage`, `PatchNotesPage`, `AddonsPage`, `SettingsPage`) with a `PageBanner` header strip; the ones with a view model of their own (`Shop`, `Armory`, `Calendar`, `PatchNotes`) bind their body to it. `GoToAsync` switches the page and asks the portal for what it shows: the armory and calendar feeds are asked again when their last answer is a minute old, the patch notes every visit. A page that stops applying (the shop after a logout, the armory on a realm without one, the addons page when the client goes) sends the player home (`LeaveUnavailablePage`). Dialogs stay dialogs: Add Addon, realm selection, confirms and error boxes open over the main window. A branded `Assets/Branding/background.jpg` (or `.png`) replaces the background (DragonUI's rock ground with a warm glow) when present.

* **The client's `Cache` folder is cleared** when a patch is installed, updated or removed (`PatchService.ClearClientCache`), and once per client whenever the realm's `realm/cache-version.txt` changes (`ClearCacheIfRealmAsksAsync`, after refreshes and before launch).

* **Combat logs are shared with the realm only when the player turns it on** (`CombatLogUploadService`, `MainViewModel.CombatLog.cs`; Settings, off by default, and only shown when the portal's `api/launcher/combatlog.php` says the realm collects them). While it's on, the launcher writes its own addon into the client the game runs from (`Interface/AddOns/PortalkeeperCombatLog`, not in the realm's addon list) and deletes it when it's off; the addon turns combat logging on inside dungeons and raids. A log that was already there when the player opted in is renamed in place (`WoWCombatLog-before-sharing-...txt`), never uploaded. After the game exits, and once at start-up, `Logs/WoWCombatLog.txt` is moved to `Logs/PortalkeeperUpload/`, gzipped and uploaded in parts, and deleted only when the portal confirms it. Uploads never hold up a launch, stop when the game starts or Portalkeeper closes, fail quietly and continue next time; a log still waiting after 14 days is deleted.

* **The coin shop** (`CoinShopService`, `ShopViewModel`, `ShopPage`, `MainViewModel.Shop.cs` and `.Pages.cs`): the SHOP page, its link shown for the built-in realm once the portal's `api/launcher/shop.php` has answered a listing for this login (404 means the realm has no shop). The page's view model is made on the first visit and lives, with its listing and pictures, until the player logs out or changes realm. Players spend the Tarnished Undermine Reals in their account wallet (mod-boss-coins) on mounts, companions and character services for one character at a time; BUY always asks first. The portal caches a listing for 15 seconds, so the page never polls: it asks on every visit, after a purchase and on REFRESH. A purchase without an answer (502, a lost connection) may have gone through, so the listing is fetched again and the player is told to look at the balance; that warning stays up even when the refresh fails, the top bar's links are off while a purchase is on its way (`CanNavigate`), and a self-update waits for it. A 401 from the shop goes back to the login screen (a 403 is only shown). The page is laid out like the retail game's shop: category tabs (MOUNTS first, where it opens; no "all" tab), a search box with Show (everything / can buy now / not owned / owned) and Sort (shop order, name, price) for the tab, offer tiles on the left, the picked offer large on a stage on the right with its description, price and BUY. An offer the portal gives a `preview` (a strip of turntable frames, `ShopPreviewService` keeps them on disk by URL) shows its model on the tile and on the stage, where the player turns it by dragging (`ShopTurntable`; it never turns on its own); others keep their drawn icon. An offer the portal marks `account` (a mount or companion on a realm that shares them) is bought for the whole account: the confirm step says so, the stage says every character gets it, and nothing is mailed. An offer the realm's progression hasn't opened for the account yet (mod-boss-coins `locked`, with `unlock` saying what opens it) shows a lock on its tile and the unlock line on the stage, and can't be bought. Tiles decode a small copy of the strip; only the last few stage pictures stay decoded at full size.

* **Crash reports** (`CrashReportService`, `MainViewModel.CrashReport.cs`): after the game exits, error reports it wrote while it ran (`Errors/*.txt`, newer than the launch) bring up a banner over the status card. When the portal's `api/launcher/crashreport.php` says the realm takes them, the banner offers SEND REPORT / ALWAYS SEND (Settings: "Send crash reports without asking", off by default). The `User:` and `Computer:` lines, the user folder in paths and the Windows user and computer names are taken out before anything is sent. The banner also points at REPAIR GAME.

* **REPAIR GAME** (`MainViewModel.Repair.cs`; Settings and the crash banner): clears Cache, reinstalls every required realm addon and every realm addon the launcher installed, then forgets the client torrent's resume data (`TorrentService.ForgetResumeAsync`) so the update that follows hash-checks every client file, with progress, and downloads what is damaged. The sync after it re-hashes the patches. The player's own addons and WTF settings are not touched.

* **Live info and what's new on the home screen** (`RealmLiveService`, `MainViewModel.Live.cs`): under the realm status pill, from the built-in realm's portal only. The dots: players green; a restart amber, red within five minutes; events green, one row per event (at most four, then "+N more events on") with a line on what it is for the holidays the launcher knows (`DescribeEvent`: a holiday run as several game events, like the Stranglethorn fishing pools, shows once; the realm's own events show by name only); world bosses green with every one up, amber with some, red with none. `api/launcher/live.php` (players online and bots, a pending restart, world events on, rares and world bosses up) is asked with the realm status every 45 seconds; `api/launcher/whatsnew.php` (patch notes merged since `LastPlayedUtc`, the last ENTER REALM) at start, after the game exits and every 15 minutes. Both hide when the portal doesn't answer. The card shows real players online only, never bots (once booted every bot is online, and while the realm boots the status card counts them from realm-status.json); that line hides while the realm boots or its world server is down. Booting or restarting soon, the ENTER REALM button shows only STARTING UP / RESTARTING, since the status card beside it gives the bot count or restart time.

* **The PATCH NOTES page** (`PatchNotesViewModel`, `PatchNotesPage`): the same `whatsnew.php` notes, asked for the last 90 days and as many as the portal gives at once (50), grouped by day, newest first, with every line; "+N more" and FULL NOTES ON THE WEBSITE open `changelog.php` in the browser. ALL PATCH NOTES on the home screen opens the page. Shown for the built-in realm only.

* **DragonUI's look** (`Views/DragonUI.cs`, `Views/DragonStyles.axaml`, `Assets/DragonUI`, MIT): the window and its pages use the realm's in-game DragonUI style, drawn from DragonUI's own textures with its atlas offsets: a bronze window frame (`DragonFrame Kind=Bronze`, its title band is the top bar), gold-filigree insets over marble for cards and sections (`DragonFrame`, `Button.inset`), a rock ground, and red three-slice buttons (`RedButtonChrome`, every button without the link/chrome/gold/plain/inset class). The window is borderless: the bronze frame at Scale 1.6 with the top bar on its title band (the page links, with the open page's in gold over a gold line; WEBSITE; the gear; minimize; close; drag to move). The dialogs that remain (Add Addon, realm selection) keep `DragonTitleBar` on theirs. Page headers are `PageBanner` (`Assets/Calendar/header-banner.png`, the skyline without painted text, the page's name in Cinzel gold, `TextBlock.dragon-title`, and the page's own controls at the right). Buttons that keep their own look (calendar days, shop tabs and tiles) carry the `plain` class. No top-left portrait icon anywhere.

Keep these changes out of upstream pull requests.

## Project Purpose

Portalkeeper is a cross-platform launcher and client-management tool for World of Warcraft 3.3.5a private realms.

Its responsibilities include:

* validating an existing WoW 3.3.5a client installation
* managing realm configuration
* managing supported custom addons
* applying realm-specific client settings
* launching the client
* supporting realm-specific requirements such as addons and patch files

Upstream Portalkeeper does not distribute the World of Warcraft client; this fork does, only through the BitTorrent install described above.

## Supported Platforms

Portalkeeper must remain functional on:

* Windows x64
* Linux x64

Do not solve a platform-specific problem by breaking behavior on the other supported platform.

When introducing native libraries or platform-specific behavior:

* isolate platform-specific code where practical
* preserve existing behavior on unaffected platforms
* verify runtime and publish paths separately from compile-time behavior
* do not assume Windows filesystem, path, executable, or library-loading behavior applies to Linux
* do not assume Linux behavior applies to Windows

## Technology

Portalkeeper uses:

* .NET
* Avalonia UI

Prefer existing project patterns and APIs before introducing new abstractions or dependencies.

Do not introduce Visual Studio-specific project requirements.

The project should remain buildable and maintainable using standard .NET CLI tooling.

## Architecture Principles

### Realm Configuration

Realm-specific behavior belongs in realm configuration when practical.

Examples include:

* realm address
* realm-specific addon requirements
* realm-specific client patch requirements
* other settings required to connect correctly to a particular realm

Do not duplicate realm-specific state in global application configuration unless compatibility or migration requires it.

### Global Configuration

Application-wide preferences that are not specific to one realm belong in Portalkeeper's global configuration.

Keep the distinction between global application settings and realm-specific requirements clear.

### Existing Behavior

Preserve working behavior outside the requested task.

Do not casually change:

* configuration formats
* configuration defaults
* file locations
* addon installation behavior
* client validation behavior
* launch behavior
* native dependency handling
* backup behavior
* Linux behavior while fixing Windows
* Windows behavior while fixing Linux

If a requested feature requires one of these behaviors to change, make that change explicit and keep it narrowly scoped.

## Client Handling

Portalkeeper works with a user's existing World of Warcraft 3.3.5a installation.

Apart from the fork's hash-verified BitTorrent client install (see above), do not add functionality that assumes Portalkeeper distributes Blizzard client files.

Client-related functionality may inspect or manage files in the user's existing client installation when required for Portalkeeper features.

Be conservative when modifying client files.

When replacing or modifying existing files:

* preserve recoverability where appropriate
* avoid destructive behavior when a safer approach exists
* do not overwrite unrelated client data
* verify paths before performing file operations

## WoW 3.3.5a Validation

Portalkeeper validates that the selected client is appropriate for WoW 3.3.5a.

Existing validation behavior should be reused rather than duplicated.

Do not weaken validation merely to make a new feature easier to implement.

If validation must change, inspect the current validator and understand its assumptions first.

## Realm Configuration Files

Realm configuration files (Schema v1) are the authoritative source for realm-specific requirements.

When adding new realm configuration capabilities:

* extend the existing parser/model pattern
* preserve compatibility when required by the task
* validate malformed or missing values appropriately
* avoid scattering realm parsing logic across unrelated UI code
* keep parsing, runtime behavior, and UI responsibilities appropriately separated

Do not redesign the entire configuration system while implementing one configuration field or section.

## Addon Management

Portalkeeper manages selected custom addons used by supported realms.

Existing functionality includes operations such as:

* install
* update
* update all
* remove

Addon definitions may include repository or source information used by Portalkeeper to manage the addon.

When modifying addon management:

* preserve existing working install/update/remove behavior unless explicitly changing it
* distinguish addon metadata from installed addon state
* avoid embedding realm-specific addon requirements in global code when they belong in realm configuration
* keep filesystem operations safe and predictable
* validate paths before deleting or replacing addon directories

Do not broaden an addon-management change into an unrelated redesign of the launcher.

## Realm Patch Requirements

Portalkeeper supports realm-specific client patch requirements.

A realm configuration describes which client patch files that realm requires (`[Patch.<key>]` sections), and Portalkeeper determines whether the selected client satisfies them before connecting to the realm.

Do not assume patch files are identical across realms.

Do not distribute Blizzard-owned assets as part of Portalkeeper (in the release package; the client torrent described above is the exception).

Prefer validation and management of files already legitimately available to the user or supplied by the realm (the realm's own patches and, in this fork, the hash-verified client torrent).

## Native Libraries

Some functionality may require native dependencies such as StormLib.

When working with native libraries:

* account for Windows and Linux separately
* verify the native library is included in the correct publish output
* verify runtime loading searches the location where the library is actually deployed
* do not treat successful compilation as proof that native runtime loading works
* preserve unaffected platform behavior

## UI Changes

Portalkeeper uses Avalonia.

When modifying UI:

* follow existing visual and layout patterns
* avoid unnecessary redesign
* preserve existing functionality outside the requested change
* keep business logic out of UI code when an existing service/model layer is appropriate
* consider window resizing and normal layout behavior
* consider both Windows and Linux behavior

Do not introduce a new UI framework or unrelated styling system.

## Dependencies

Do not add a dependency merely because it makes a small task easier.

Before adding a dependency:

1. Check whether the project already has equivalent functionality.
2. Check whether the .NET runtime or existing dependencies provide what is needed.
3. Confirm the dependency supports Windows and Linux if the affected feature is cross-platform.
4. Ensure the dependency is necessary for the requested task.

Document why a new dependency is required.

## Scope Discipline

Treat each requested task as narrowly scoped.

Before editing:

* identify the requested behavior
* locate the relevant implementation
* inspect surrounding dependencies
* identify existing patterns to follow

Do not perform unrelated:

* refactoring
* renaming
* formatting
* cleanup
* modernization
* dependency updates
* architecture changes
* documentation rewrites

If an unrelated problem is discovered, report it separately rather than fixing it automatically.

## Debugging

Do not guess at fixes.

For bugs or failures:

1. Reproduce or inspect the failure.
2. Read the complete relevant error output.
3. Trace the relevant code path.
4. Find similar working behavior where useful.
5. Form a specific root-cause hypothesis.
6. Test the smallest practical change.
7. Implement the fix only after evidence supports the cause.

Do not stack speculative fixes.

If repeated fixes fail, stop and reconsider the assumptions or architecture.

## Verification

Implementation is not completion.

For code changes, use the appropriate verification available for the task.

At minimum, when applicable:

```bash
dotnet build
```

Also use relevant tests when they exist.

For packaging or publishing changes, create and inspect the actual publish/package output.

For native dependencies, verify the expected native files are present in the produced output.

For runtime-sensitive changes, distinguish between:

* compiled successfully
* verified by inspection
* actually run and tested

Do not claim testing occurred on a platform that was not actually tested.

## Git Review

Before reporting a coding task complete, inspect:

```bash
git status --short
git diff
```

Review all changed and untracked files.

Every intentional source change should be necessary for the requested task.

Generated build, publish, cache, temporary, and diagnostic artifacts should not become source changes unless explicitly required as deliverables.

The `dist/` directory is not source code and should remain excluded from normal repository changes.

## Completion Report

After completing an implementation task, report:

* files intentionally changed
* what behavior changed
* build or test commands actually run
* results of those commands
* anything verified only through inspection
* anything that still requires platform-specific or manual testing
* unrelated issues discovered but intentionally left unchanged

Do not say a feature is complete merely because the code was written.
